HTML
- HyperText Markup Language
- markup language that web developers use to structure and
  describe the content of a webpage (not a programming
  language)
- HTML consists of elements that describe different types
  of content
- Web Browsers understand HTML code as websites

HTML Element
- Opening tag
  ~ Name of the element, wrapped in < and >
- Content
  ~ Content of the element, in this example text
  ~ But it might be another element (child element)
  * Some elements have no content
- Closing tag
  ~ Same as opening tag, but with a /.
  * When element has no content, it's omitted

- copy 02-HTML-Fundamentals from the starter folder inside
  the html-css-course-master folder and paste it anywhere,
  in our case it's in xampp/htdocs/Build Responsive 
  Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS
- create index.html
- create the basic structure of HTML
  ~ <!DOCTYPE html>
    o this indicates that the doctype is html
  ~ <html></html>
    o this is the main part of the html document/file
    o there are two parts: head, body
  ~ <head></head>
    o this is the part not visible in the content
    o stylings, title, etc.
  ~ <body></body>
    o this is the part of the content is displayed
    o paragraphs, headings, etc.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h1>
  </body>
</html>

* headings are used to logically divide sections apart
- there are 6 variations of headings:
  ~ h1
  ~ h2
  ~ h3
  ~ h4
  ~ h5
  ~ h6
* it is a good practice to only have 1 h1 per webpage

- comments are done by using <!-- -->
* comments are not visible in the website

- the bold tag (<b></b>) can be used to bold the text
* the bold tag is an old html tag and is not used anymore 
  in html5 because it does not hold a semantic meaning, 
  strong tag (<strong></strong>) is used that means to
  focus that text

- the italic tag (<i></i>) can be used to italicize text
* the italic tag is an old html tag and is not used anymore
  in html5 because it does not hold a semantic meaning,
  emphasize tag (<em></em>) is used that means to emphasize
  that text

- the ordered list tag (<ol></ol>) is used for ordered list
- the unordered list tag (<ul></ul>) is used for unordered 
  list
- the list item tag (<li></li>) is used for each list inside
  an ordered / unordered list

- the image tag (<img />) is used to display an image
* there is no content in an image tag
- we will use attributes to modify the image
* attributes are a piece of data of the element
  ~ src="" is the source of the image
  ~ alt="" is the description of the image
  * alt="" is very important and should always be included
  ~ width="" is the width of the image
  ~ height="" is the height of the image

- we will add language attribute to html tag
  ~ lang="" is the language used in your html document

- we will add meta tag in our head sections
  ~ meta tag (<meta />) is for the charset used in the 
    document
  ~ ex: <meta charset="UTF-8" />

- anchor tag (<a></a>) is used for hyperlinks / links
  ~ href attribute (href="") is the link itself
  * href="#" is just a place holder and if clicked
    will send you to the top of the page
  ~ target="_blank" will open the link on a new tab
- create blog.html file
- link the index.html to blog.html

- container elements group up the elements
  ~ navigation tag (<nav></nav>) is used for navigation
    part / links
  ~ header tag (<header></header>) is used for the top
    part
  ~ article tag (<article></article>) is used for the main
    content
  ~ aside tag (<aside></aside>) is where there is a relative
    info to the main content of the page
  ~ footer tag (<footer></footer>) is used for the bottom
    part
  ~ div tag (<div></div>) is used to group up elements
  * html entities may be used such as &copy; which is the
    copyright sign
  * a list of html entities are provided in this url:
    https://codingheroes.io/resources/

* samentic is the meaning

- install additional extensions:
  ~ image preview
    o previews images
  ~ color highlight
    o visualizing colors in css
  ~ auto rename tag
    o automatically changes the name of close tag if you
      change the name of open tag
  ~ live server
    o click Go Live at the very bottom to open the server

* if you disabled auto close tag, enable it again in settings

- create img folder and place all images inside that folder
* easier way to get the path of image is right clicking the image
  and select "copy relative path"
- paste that on the src of the image tag

        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <em>fundamental</em>
        technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
        web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
        <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
        language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
        of a webpage (not a programming language).
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You can learn more at the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
          target="_blank"
          >MDN Web Docs</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
        web. Here are 5 of them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
          Worpress or Wix
        </li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
