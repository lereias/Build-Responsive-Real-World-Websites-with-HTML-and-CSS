* there is a section container element, use for sections
* there is a span element which is a generic inline
  element
* blockquote element is used for quotations / testimonials
* there is a figure element that is said to be used if
  entire thing is part of the normal flow
  * figure element is commonly used for product cards

WEB DESIGN VS. DEVELOPMENT
- Web designers create the overall look and feel of a
  website
- Web developers implement the design using HTML, CSS,
  and JavaScript code
* GOAL IS TO BE BOTH DESIGNER AND DEVELOPER

Why take design seriously?

Good design
- creates an immediate and lasting good impression of
  the brand or product
- makes the user trust the brand right away
- increases the user's perceived value of the brand or
  product
- gives users exactly what they were looking for when
  coming to the site, e.g. purchasing a product or
  finding information

Bad design
- makes users believe the brand doesn't really care about
  their product or service
- makes the user insecure about trusting the brand
- makes the brand or product seem "cheap"
- leaves users confused, and makes it hard for them to
  reach their goal

Anyone can learn good design!
- good web design is not subjective or creative
- everyone can learn basics by following a framework /
  system
* instructor (Jonas Schmedtmann) learned and deconstructed
  100s of well-designed sites
* it is distilled into easy-to-learn and easy-to-apply
  rules
* divided in 9 different areas of design
  ~ ingredients
* rules will be applied based on website personality

Web Design Ingredients you will learn about
1. Typography
2. Colors
3. Images / illustrations
4. Icons
5. Shadows
6. Border-radius
7. Whitespace
8. Visual Heirarchy
9. User Experience
10.Components / Layout
* design decisions for each ingredient are based on
  website personality

Website Personalities
1. Serious / Elegant
   ~ for luxury and elegance, based on thin serif
     typefaces, golder or pastel colors, and big
     high-quality images
2. Minimalist / Simple
   ~ Focuses on the essntial text content, using small
     or medium-sized sans-serif black text, lines, and
     few images and icons
3. Plain / Neutral
   ~ design that gets out of the way by using neutral and
     small typefaces, and a very structured layout
   ~ Common in big corporations
4. Bold / Confident
   ~ makes an impact, by featuring big and bold typography,
     paired with confident use of big and bright colored
     blocks
5. Calm / Peaceful
   ~ For products and services that care, transmitted by
     calming pastel colors, soft serif headings, and
     matching images / illustrations
6. Startup / Upbeat
   ~ widely used in startups, featuring medium-sized
     sans-serif typefaces, light-grey text and backgrounds,
     and rounded elements
7. Playful / Fun
   ~ colorful and round designs, fueled by creative
     elements like hard-drawn icons or illustrations,
     animations, and fun language


TYPOGRAPHY
- typography is the art and technique of arranging type
  to make written language legible, readable, and
  appealing when displayed. - Wikipedia
- serif
  ~ has serifs that look like some tails
  ~ conveys trustworthiness
  ~ good for long text
- sans-serif
  ~ no serifs
  ~ clean and simple
  ~ easier to choose for beginner designer

Rules:
- use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe

* all fonts are available in:
  ~ Google Fonts
  ~ Font Squirrel

Sans-serif
- Inter
- Open Sans
- Roboto
- Montserrat
- Work Sans
- Lato

Serif
- Merriweather
- Aleo
- Playfair Display
- Cormorant
- Cardo
- Lora

- it's okay to use just one typeface per page! If you
  want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
- choose the right typeface according to your website
  personality:
  ~ choose the right personality for your website
    (more on this later)
  ~ decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
  ~ experiment with all the "good" typefaces (and other
    typefaces from Google Fonts!) to see which ones best
    fits your website's message (this will come with
    experience)
  ~ you can keep trying different typefaces as you design
    and build the page

- when choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type
  scale" tool or other pre-defined range
  * good tool for creating your type scales is:
    https://type-scale.com/
- use a font size between 16px and 32px for "normal" text
- for long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px
  or even bigger
- for headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold
  (600+), depending on personality
- for any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)

- use less than 75 characters per line
- for normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5
  and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
  ~ the smaller or longer the text, the larger the line
    height needs to be!
- decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks
  unnatural (this will come from experience)
- experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them
  small and bold and increase letter-spacing
- usually, don't justify text
- don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine


- proceed to the chair project
* for architect minimalist its best use sans-serif, more
  specifically inter
- search google fonts and search for inter:
  https://fonts.google.com/
* Styles are the different font-weight versions of the
  text
* copy and paste the link tags presented before the CSS
  styles in the head tag
* in the body do:
  body {
    font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
  }
  * the font-family that is the left-most will be applied
    and in cases that it is not available, the next one
    will be applied


COLORS

Rules:
- make the main color match your website's personality:
  colors convey meaning!
  ~ RED draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power,
    passion, and excitement
  ~ ORANGE is less aggresive, and conveys happiness,
    cheerfulness, and creativity
  ~ YELLOW means joy, brightness, and intelligence
  ~ GREEN represents harmony, nature, growth, and health
  ~ BLUE is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and
    professionalism
  ~ PURPLE conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic
  ~ PINK represents romance, care, and affection
  ~ BROWN is associated with nature, durability and
    comfort
  ~ BLACK symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but
    also grief and sorrow

- good color tone! Don't choose a random tone or CSS named
  colors
  * tools that can be used are the following:
    o Open Color
      > https://yeun.github.io/open-color/
    o tailwindcss
      > https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors
    o FLAT UI COLORS 2
      > https://flatuicolors.com/

- you need at least two types of colors in your color
  palette: a main color and a grey color
  * grey color is not actually color grey, just a darker
    color

- with more experience, you can add more colors: accent
  (secondary) colors (use a tool)
- for diversity, create lighter and darker "versions"
  * lighter "versions" are called tints
  * darker "versions" are called shades
  * tools that can be used are the following:
    o Open Color
      > https://yeun.github.io/open-color/
    o tailwindcss
      > https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors
    o palleton
      > https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
    o coolors
      > https://coolors.co/
    o tint & shade generator
      > https://maketintsandshades.com/

- use your main color to draw attention to the most
  important elements on the page
  * mostly used on buttons
- use colors to add interesting accents or make entire
  components or sections stand out
- you can try to use your color strategically in images
  and illustrations

Colors and Typography
- on dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the
  background ("lighter version") for text
- text should usually not be completely black. Lighten
  it up if it looks heavy and uninviting
- don't make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast
  between text and background colors
  * contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal
    text and 3:1 for large text (18px+)
    * use coolors for that (color contrast checker)

* links are used if you are navigated elsewhere, out of
  the current page
* buttons are used if there is something have taken action
  after pressing it
* create a major classname for the same element and create
  classnames more specific to it for its variations

- apply this to the chair project

IMAGES AND ILLUSTRATIONS

Types of images
- product photos
  ~ for products
- storytelling photos
  ~ users using your product
  ~ visually tells your message
  ~ most important and prominent among them all
- illustrations
  ~ getting more and more popular
  ~ abstract way of doing story-telling
  ~ adds originality and personality
  ~ can be 2D or 3D
- patterns
  ~ applied as background or behind images

- use images to support your website's message and story.
  So only use relevant images!
- prefer original images. If not possible, use
  original-looking stock images (not generic ones!)
  * places to get images:
    o Unsplash
      > https://unsplash.com/
    o Pexels
      > https://www.pexels.com/
    o DrawKit
      > https://drawkit.com/
    o unDraw
      > https://undraw.co/illustrations

- try to show real people to trigger user's emotions
- if necessary, crop images to fit your message
- experiment combining photos, illustrations and patterns

Handling text on images
- method#1: darken or brighten image (completely or
  or partially, using a gradient)
- method#2: position text into neutral image area
- method#3: put text in a box
- method#4: put text-shadow on text

Some technical details
- to account for high-res screens, make image dimensions
  2x big as their displayed size
  ~ Scale factor
    o actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels
      represented on screen
    o on high-res screens, scale factor is 2x or even 3x,
      on "normal" screens it's just 1x (1 physical pixel
      = 1 design pixel)

- compress images for a lower file size and better
  performance
  * tools that can be used:
    o Squoosh
      > https://squoosh.app/

- when using multiple images side-by-side, makes sure they
  have the exact same dimensions


ICONS

Rules:
- use a good icon pack, there are a tons of free and paid
  icon packs
  * tools to have icons:
    o Phosphor icons
      > https://phosphoricons.com/
    o Ionicons
      > https://ionic.io/ionicons
    o ICONS8
      > https://icons8.com/
    o heroicons
      > https://heroicons.com/
  * you can use emojis as well

- use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from different
  icon packs
- use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don't use bitmap image
  formats (.jpg and .png)!
  * Vector-based
    ~ SVG images and icon fonts
    ~ scale indefinitely!
  * Bitmap
    ~ "Regular images": JPG, PNG, GIF
    ~ Do not scale, become unsharp!

- adjust to website personality! Roundness, weight and
  filled / outlined depend on typography

When to use icons
- use icons to provide visual assistance to text
- use icons for product feature blocks
- use icons associated with actions, and label them
  (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)
- use icons as bullet points

Use icons well
- to keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw
  more attention, use different color
- don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and
  fit the text or action!
- don't make icons larger than what they were designed
  for. If needed, enclose them in a shape

- do the chair project, apply icons
* svg images are svg elements (<svg></svg>)
* they have default classes in them, you can change them
  to whatever you desire
  ~ properties involved with svg elements:
    o stroke
      > color of the line of the svg
    o fill
      > color of the fill of the svg
    o width / height
      > change dimension of svg

* there is a trick that you can have multiple cursors
  in VS Code
  * for windows, use alt key and click the line
  * for mac, use cmd key and click the line


SHADOWS

Some CONCEPTS First
- Skeuomorphic Design
  ~ 2010
  ~ glossy, shadows, realistic
- Flat Design (Minimal)
  ~ no shadows
- Flat Design (2.0)
  ~ shadows is back but not much realistic

- after an era of 100% flat design, we're now back to
  using shadows in UI design ("flat design 2.0")
- shadows creates depth (3D): the more shadow, the further
  away from the interface the element is
- shadow can be used on boxes and text

Rules:
- you don't have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes
  sense for the website personality
* From Serious / Elegant -> Playful / Fun
  ~ Serious / Elegant has less shadows
  ~ Playful / Fun has more shadows
- use shadows in small doses: don't add shadows to every
  element!
- go light on shadows, don't make them too dark!

Use shadows in the right situation
- use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand
  out (to draw attention)
  * buttons and icons / icon backgrounds
- use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should
  stand out a bit more
  * make cards stand out from the interface
- use large shadows for elements that should really float
  above the interface
  * navigations and pop-ups
- experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction
  * mouse-click
    ~ normal
      o no shadow
    ~ hover
      o has shadow
    ~ click
      o no shadow
- Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)

- implement shadows to the chair project
- box-shadow property is the way we create shadows for
  boxes / containers
  * box-shadow property has multiple values:
    o box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px 10px #000
      > first value is for the horizontal off-set
      > second value is for the vertical off-set
      > third value is the blur
      > fourth value is the spread (optional)
      > fifth value is the color (optional)

* the best opacity of shadow (transparency / alpha) is 
  0.1

- text-shadow property is the way we create shadows for
  text
  * text-shadow property has multiple values:
    o text-shadow: 10px 10px 10px #000
      > first value is for the horizontal off-set
      > second value is for the vertical off-set
      > third value is the blur
      > fourth value is the color (optional)

* In VS Code, hover on the property on the css rules and 
  click the "MDN Web Docs" to redirect to the documentation
  of the property

* learn more on mdn web docs:
  ~ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow
  ~ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow
* you can add multiple shadows for one box / container
  or one text


BORDER-RADIUS
- the roundness of corners

Rules:
- use border-radius to increase the playfulness and fun of
  the design, to make it less serious
  * From Serious / Elegant => Playful / Fun
    ~ Serious / Elegant has less border-radius
    ~ Playful / Fun has more border-radius

- typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that
  border-radius matches that roundness!
- use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons,
  standout sections, and other elements

- apply border-radius to chair project
- border-radius property is used to change the curveness /
  sharpness of the corners
  * there are variants:
    o border-top-left-radius
    o border-top-right-radius
    o border-bottom-right-radius
    o border-bottom-left-radius
  * border-radius property is a shorthand property that
    affects multiple properties
    o border-radius: 100px;
      > will apply 100px border-radius to all corners
    o border-radius: 100px 0;
      > first value will apply to top-left and
        bottom-right
      > second value will apply to top-right and
        bottom-left
    o border-radius: 20px 30px 40px 50px;
      > the values will apply to a clock-wise rotation
        starting from the top-left
      > first value is for top-left
      > second value is for top-right
      > third value is for bottom-right
      > fourth value is for the bottom-left

- apply border-radius to chair project


WHITESPACE
- the right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean,
  modern and polished
- whitespace communicates how different pieces of
  information are related to one another
- whitespace implies invisible relationships between the
  elements of a layout

Rules:
- use tons of whitespace between sections
- use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements
- use whitespace between elements
- inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead
  of lines

How much whitespace
- the more some elements (or groups of elements) belong
  together, the closer they should be!
  ~ The "Law of Proximity"
- start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much!
  Then remove whitespace from there
  * too much whitespace looks detached, too little looks
    too crammed
- match other design choices. If you have big text or big
  icons, you need more whitespace
- try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all
  spacing


VISUAL HIERARCHY
- visual hierarchy is about establishing which elements
  of a design are the most important ones
- visual hierarchy is about drawing attention to these
  most important elements
- visual hierarchy is about defining a "path" for users,
  to guide them through the page
- we use a combination of position, size, colors, spacing,
  borders, and shadows to establish a meaningful visual
  hierarchy between elements / components

Visual Hierarchy Fundamentals
- position important elements closer to the top of the
  page, where they get more attention
  * attention flows down the page (and components)
- use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention
  (larger images get more attention)
- whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace
  strategically to emphasize elements

Visual Hierarchy for Text Elements
- for text elements, use font size, font weight, color,
  and whitespace to convey importance
- what text elements to emphasize? Titles, sub-titles,
  links, buttons, data points, icons
  * you can also de-emphasize less important text, like
    labels or secondary / additional information

Visual Hierarchy Between Components
- emphasize an important component using background color,
  shadow, or border (or multiple)
- try emphasizing some component A over component B by
  de-emphasizing component B
- what components to emphasize? Testimonials, 
  call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview
  cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows / columns
  in tables, etc.

- implement white space and visual hierarchy


USER EXPERIENCE (UX)
- Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.
  Design is how it works - Steve Jobs
  ~ looks like and feels like
    o User interface (UI) is the visual presentation
      of a product. It's how the graphical interface
      looks and feels like
      > Layout
      > "Personality"
      > Typography, colors, icons, etc.
  ~ how it works
    o User Experience (UX) is the overall experience the
      user has while interacting with the product
      > does the app feel logical and well thought out?
      > does the navigation work intuitively?
      > are users reaching their goals?

UI and UX Design
- UI is graphical interface
  ~ UI Design is what makes an interface beautiful
- UX is experience with interface
  ~ UX Design is what makes an interface useful and
    functional
* UX Design can not exist without UI Design

UX Design Guiding Principle: goals
- A website or application exists for a reason: a user has
  a goal for visiting it, and a business has a goal for
  creating it
  ~ User Goals and Business Goals
  * good UX design aligns the user's goals with the
    business' goals
  * highlighting an option in the product pricing table
    o helps the user decide faster what is the best option
    o helps the business maximize revenue

UX Rules for USABILITY
- don't design complicated latyouts. Don't reinvent the
  wheel. Use patterns that users know
  * familiarity is much more needed than being original
- make your call-to-action the most prominent element,
  and make the text descriptive
- use blue text and underlined text only for links!
- animations should have a purpose and be fast:
  between 200 and 500 ms
- in forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical
  line, to make the form easier to scan
- offer users good feedback for all actions: form errors,
  form success, etc. [web apps]
- place action buttons where they will create an effect
  [web apps]
  ~ the law of locality
  * adding new tasks call-to-action should be at the
    bottom

UX Rules for Website content
- use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your
  main page. Don't be vague or fancy!
- only include relevant information, efficiently! Cut
  out fluff and make the content 100% clear
- use simple words! Avoid technical jargon and
  "smart-sounding" words
- break up long text with sub-headings, images,
  block quotes, bullet points, etc.


THE WEBSITE-PERSONALITIES FRAMEWORK
- 100s of well-designed deconstructed
  ~ distilled into countless of web design rules that
    we just learned
    * rules should be applied according to selected
      website personality
  ~ distilled into 7 website personalities

Website Personality
- the theme or vibe in the overall feel of the website

Process of deciding
- How do you want website to appear to users? What "vibe"
  do you want to transmit?
- Choose one of the website personalities accordingly
- apply personality traits to each design ingredients
