High-Level Overview of Web Development
- Static Website
  * Website where files are simply sent to browser as they are
  ~ Web Browser sends a request to the Web Server where the Site is hosted
  ~ Web Server sends a response (sends files such as HTML, CSS, JS, and images 
    involved in the site) to the Web Browser
  ~ Web Browser will display the Website
  ~ involves mostly the front-end
  * front-end develepmont is the process of writing the files such as HTML, CSS, and 
    JS

- Dynamic Website
  * Website files are "assembled" on the server
  ~ Web Browser sends a request to the Web Server where the Site is hosted
  ~ Apps and Databases are running in the server
  ~ The back-end (node.js, php, python, etc.) are the ones running
  * back-end development is the process of witing the hidden files (node.js, php,
    python, etc.) involved in a website
  ~ Web Server sends a response (sends files such as HTMl, CSS, JS, and images and
    result from the apps and databases involved in the site) to the Web Browser
  ~ Web Browser will display the Website

- 3 Languages of Front-end
  ~ HTML
    o Content
    o Noun (<p></p> is paragraph)
  ~ CSS
    o Presentation / Style
    o Adjective (p {color:red} means "the paragraph text is red")
  ~ JS
    o Dynamic effects / functionalities and web applications
    o Verb (p.hide(); means "hide the paragraph")

Setting Up Code Editor
- VS Code is suggested
- download extension named "Prettier"
- in settings, search default format
- under Editor: Default Formatter choose "Prettier - Code Formatter"
- in settings, search for format on save then check the box
- in settings, search for auto save and choose onFocusChange
* onFocusChange will save the file when you go to other files/tab
- optionally, you may search for tab size and change it to 2
- optionally, you may download an extension named "One Monokai Theme" to match the
  theme

Coding of a Basic Webpage
- create a folder (project folder)
- open folder in VS Code
- create index.html file
* index.html is the default first page of any website
* in index.html, type "!" and press enter/tab
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>My name is Lee, and this is my very first webpage</p>
  </body>
